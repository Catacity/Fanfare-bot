Description
------
This simple discord bot plays fanfare music whenever a discord user, who was not previously in a channel, joins a channel.
It also works as a music bot. The bot supports the following commands for playing music: play, resume, pause, disconnect <br />.

This project uses replit. Feel free to use it as a template or a starting point for your music bot if you like :)
